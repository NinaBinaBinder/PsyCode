### 3D Interactive Personality Visualization with p5.js

This project uses the p5.js library to create dynamic and interactive 3D visualizations based on user input values. By leveraging WebGL, the visualization features animated, irregular shapes whose colors, sizes, and forms vary according to input data. The sketch adapts in real-time to changes in user inputs, providing a visually engaging and responsive experience.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
